This program takes in an mp4 file and runs ORB i.e. key feature detection on each image in the mp4 file. Doing so helps us realise the frames 
that are unique in the video which allows us to make a summary of the video. ORB was used as the primary technique as it is similar to SIFT/SURF with 
enhanced pace to solve the algorithm rather quickly.
